	<div class="middle aligned content">We will conduct methods in biotechnology such as commercial micropropagation, hybrid breeding, molecular-marker and genomic selection, phenotyping, genome duplication, CRISPR/cas9 DNA genome editing for improving quality and quantity of secondary metabolites. Consistency, scalability, reduces the risk of disease and contamination and lower costs are our based methods. Phytoceltic LSs does not use biotechnological techniques of GMO to obtain new chemo-strains. The breeding research is strictly carried out under controlled environmental conditions of light, humidity, carbon dioxide, air exchange, temperature and bespoke nutrients.</div>

<p>Plants synthesize an enormous array of bioactive compounds and many of these are stored in different subcellular compartments relative to their synthesis origin. Glandular trichomes (GTs) are the chemical factories for biosynthesis and storing of many compounds (e.g. cannabinoids, artemisinin). They are proposed to play a critical role in plant protection against various biotic and abiotic stresses such as extreme temperature, extreme light, herbivorous insects attack, pathogen infection. However, the density and distribution of cannabinoids within trichomes arenâ€™t well understood. For this reason, we will create a new prototype for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis.
